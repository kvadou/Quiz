JavaScript Quiz

Developed a JavaScript coding quiz with dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by JavaScript.  The coding quiz has a 60 second time limit, and if you answer a question incorrectly, this will deduct 10 seconds from your remaining time.  The game is over when you run out of time or answer all the questions.

When the game is finished, you have the opportunity to input your initials and have them displayed on the High Score Hall of Fame.  High Score Hall of Fame can be accessed form the main home page in the upper left corner.
